  var texto = "We have already left the Berlin Central Station in the direction of Constantinople. Mr. Schneider's murderer, no matter how fast he was, was unable to leave the train in any way. If I'm not mistaken, the killer is possibly still inside the Orient Express! But to decipher this enigma I will have to find a way to unmask him. Evidence indicate that the murder was possibly committed last night at around 10:00 p.m. I will have to work very hard no matter how tired I am if I want to find the passenger who committed this infamous crime. I'll start by investigating everyone who is still on the train. There are eight people in total. They all seem to have, curiously, a valid alibi. Only if I use my detective skills will I find the murderer. Clearly I'm going to have to talk to the train reviewer. He was the first to realize that something was wrong and he went to open Mr. Schneider's compartment, where he found his lifeless body. Then, in the absence of a reason or clearer evidence, I will have to inspect the compartments of the entire passage one by one. But I will have to discover something that will allow me to destroy the murderer's alibi and then I will surely be able to arrest him. Also, I highly doubt that all the passengers are telling the whole truth about what they were doing at the time! There will be no choice but to be a bit of a snooper in order to reconstruct the night of the events and locate the person whom no one saw at the time of the murder. I will write down the information I find, if it seems relevant, in this notebook...";
